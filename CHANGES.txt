- ?APRSD ?DX ?IGATE accept radio port number (0, 1, ...) as argument

- Received and sent frames can copied in UDP packets to local or remote servers,
  see UDPCC config parameter

2.2.1 - August 21, 2012

- Dropped SQLINRAM config option due to database reorganization and improved 
  performance
  
- Fixed WEB interface position sign bug with Western and Southern coordinates

- ?APRSD ?DX and ?IGATE commands accept port number (0, 1, ...)
- ?INFO command response optimized
- Added WEB server to check system status
- Added signal rate specification to radio port, required by traffic shaping

  SIGNALRATE=<fv> (RADIOPORT) - signal rate, default is 1200
  
- Gating weather bulletins (NWS and BOM messages and objects) from IS to Rf
  can be enabled on port basis separately
  
  GATENWS=<y/n> (RADIOPORT) - enable/disable NWS messages (US)
  GATEBOM=<y/n> (RADIOPORT) - enable/disable BOM messages (Australia)
  
- Adaptive traffic shaping feature added to protect Rf channel against getting
  overloaded by gated messages 

2.1.5 - July 29, 2012

- Fixed NMEA sentence decoding bug
- Added configuration options to config.txt:

  LOCALHOPS=<n> (GENERAL) - max number of digis passed for local stations
  MSGRANGE=<n>  (GENERAL) - max distance in km to gate messages to Rf

- Added processing of SIGTERM signal for compatibility to daemonization tools
 
2.1.4 - July 23, 2012

- Delivery of status messages improved
- Added DIR_CNT and RF_CNT to ?IGATE response and capability packets
- Fixed posit gating from IS to Rf when messages were gated previously
- IS to Rf gating condition changed back from distance to hop count (max. 2 by default)
- Monitor shows hop count for received frames
- Monitor now indicates category of sent frames (DIGI, LOCL or GATE)
- 'PHASE nn' debug messages turned off in igate process, related tos erver conenction status
- Added new status messages to IS server connection process
- Fixed showing stations with -9999km (invalid/unknown) distance in DX lists
- Fixed crashing on query processing when IGATE closed

2.1.3 - July 16, 2012

- Improved processing of javAAPRSsrvr status messages
- Improve status messages to reflect real status
- Added IS server connection task relaunch counter to ?PORTS status message

- Added configuration options to config.txt:

  METRIC=<y/n> (GENERAL)    - select km/mi display on console and DX list; default is km
  BCNTXT=<str> (ISGW/RADIO) - specify beacon text; %v replaced with actual version string; default is version string
  DIGIPEATER=<y/n> (RADIO)  - Enable/disable digipeater; default is enabled
  GATELOCAL=<y/n> (RADIO)   - Enable/disable gating of locally generated frames to IS server; default is disabled
  GATEDIGI=<y/n> (RADIO)    - Enable/disable gating of digipeated frames to IS server; default is disabled
